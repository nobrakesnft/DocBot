# DocBot - AI Support for Web3 Communities

> Your community's questions answered 24/7, using YOUR docs. No hallucinations. No wrong info.

---

## The Problem

- Community asks the same questions 100x/day
- Mods are burned out
- Wrong info spreads when mods are offline
- Generic bots sound robotic and give hallucinated answers

## The Solution

**DocBot** - An AI that answers questions using YOUR project's documentation.

```
User: "wen airdrop"
DocBot: "snapshot is planned for Q2 2026, no exact date yet 👍"
```

It only says what's in your docs. Nothing more.

```
Your Docs (whitepaper, FAQ, gitbook)
        ↓
    DocBot learns it
        ↓
Community asks questions
        ↓
DocBot answers from YOUR docs only
```

## Smart Behavior

**Duplicate handling:**
```
1st time: "wen airdrop" → Full answer + link
2nd time: "wen airdrop" → "just covered the airdrop above 👆"
3rd time: "wen airdrop" → "bro we just talked about the airdrop 😅"
5th time: "wen airdrop" → "no updates, gonna stop spamming the chat 🙏"
6th time: → Silent (resets after 10 mins)
```

**Unknown questions:**
```
User: "what's the token price at launch"
DocBot: "hmm price isn't in the docs - check announcements for that"
```

Never guesses. Never invents.
